## Session Context

**Continuation from**: Previous session completed Gate 6 (Documentation & Deployment Verification) but discovered privacy boundary violation.

**Starting state**:
- Gates 0-6 complete (production-ready template)
- Gate 6.1 required (privacy remediation)
- Privacy violation: Private agent names exposed in public documentation
- Status before session: NOT READY FOR PUBLIC RELEASE

## Session Objectives

### Primary Objective
Prepare template-document-processor-AGET v2.7.0 for public release to aget-framework GitHub organization.

### Specific Goals
1. ✅ Complete Gate 6.1: Privacy audit & remediation
2. ✅ Complete Gate 7.1: Pre-release verification
3. ⏸️ Complete Gate 7.2: GitHub repository creation
4. ⏸️ Complete Gate 7.3: Release v2.7.0 publication
5. ⏸️ Complete Gate 7.4: Organization documentation updates
6. ⏸️ Complete Gate 7.5: Post-release validation

## Work Completed

### Gate 6.1: Privacy Audit & Remediation (✅ COMPLETE)

**Issue identified**: Human caught privacy boundary violation - private agent names in public documentation.

**Root cause**: Worker skipped privacy audit step in Gate 6 (rushed to completion in 30 min vs 45min-1.25h estimate).

**Files with violations**:
- `.aget/version.json`: `source_agents_analyzed` array
- `CHANGELOG.md`: Analysis section
- `README.md`: "Based on L208" section
- `AGENTS.md`: "Based on Learning" section

**Remediation**:
- Removed all `private-docx-AGET` and `private-RKB-CONTENT_ENHANCER-aget` references
- Replaced with generic: "production document processing agents"
- Changed `source_agents_analyzed` → `source_pattern_count: 2`
- Re-audit confirmed clean (0 matches)

**Time**: 10 minutes (vs 10-15 min estimate)
**Outcome**: Privacy-safe for public release

### Framework Standards Audit (✅ COMPLETE)

**Triggered by**: Human questioned license type assumption (MIT vs Apache).

**5-Why Analysis**:
1. Why propose MIT? Made assumption without checking AGET standards
2. Why assume? Didn't search configuration first
3. Why not search? Saw "license" as generic decision, used common practice
4. Why use common practice? Didn't apply "check configuration first" protocol
5. Why not apply protocol? Pattern recognition failure - operated in "general knowledge mode" not "AGET-specific mode"

**Root cause**: Configuration-first protocol not applied (same pattern as Gate 6 privacy miss).

**Audit results** (6 standards verified):
- ❌ License: MIT → **Corrected to Apache 2.0**
- ✅ Repository naming: template-document-processor-AGET (correct)
- ✅ Organization: aget-framework (correct)
- ✅ Branch name: main (correct)
- ✅ Tag format: v2.7.0 (correct)
- ✅ Repository visibility: public (correct)

**Time**: 5 minutes
**Outcome**: One assumption found and corrected before public release

### Gate 7.1: Pre-Release Verification (✅ COMPLETE)

**Objective**: Final checks before public deployment.

**5 verification checks**:

1. **Privacy audit** ✅ CLEAN
   - No `private-*` agent references (0 matches)
   - No `my-*` agent references (0 matches)
   - No `~/github/` local paths (0 matches)
   - No hardcoded secrets (0 matches)

2. **Apache 2.0 LICENSE** ✅ CREATED
   - Full Apache License 2.0 text (193 lines)
   - Copyright: 2025 AGET Framework Contributors
   - README.md updated to reference Apache 2.0

3. **README.md public-ready** ✅ VERIFIED
   - No TODO/TBD/FIXME markers
   - LICENSE link valid
   - No placeholder text
   - License section updated

4. **Version consistency** ✅ CONSISTENT
   - `.aget/version.json`: 2.7.0
   - `README.md`: 2.7.0 (3 refs)
   - `CHANGELOG.md`: 2.7.0 (3 refs)
   - `AGENTS.md`: @aget-version: 2.7.0

5. **Test suite** ✅ 100% PASSING
   - Smoke tests: 20/20 passing
   - Integration tests: 10/10 passing
   - Total: 30/30 tests

**Time**: 18 minutes (vs 15-20 min estimate)
**Outcome**: Ready for public repository creation

## Key Decisions

### Decision 1: Require Gate 6.1 (Privacy Remediation)
**Context**: Privacy violation discovered in Gate 6 completion
**Options**:
- A) Fix inline without gate
- B) Create correction gate (6.1)
**Decision**: B (Gate 6.1 required)
**Rationale**: Production-blocking issue, needed systematic approach, clear checkpoint
**Outcome**: Successful - all privacy violations removed in 10 minutes

### Decision 2: Framework Standards Audit Before Gate 7.1
**Context**: License type assumption (MIT vs Apache 2.0) questioned by human
**Options**:
- A) Fix license only
- B) Audit all framework standards before proceeding
**Decision**: B (Comprehensive audit)
**Rationale**: Third miss by worker+supervisor (privacy twice, license once) suggests systemic issue, Gate 7.2+ makes repo public (harder to fix later)
**Outcome**: Successful - found 1 assumption (license), verified 5 others correct

### Decision 3: Apache 2.0 License (Not MIT)
**Context**: Worker proposed MIT, supervisor initially agreed, human corrected
**Options**:
- A) MIT (most common for templates)
- B) Apache 2.0 (AGET framework standard)
**Decision**: B (Apache 2.0)
**Rationale**: AGET framework uses Apache 2.0 as standard license
**Outcome**: LICENSE file created with Apache 2.0, README updated

## Blockers Encountered

### Blocker 1: Privacy Boundary Violation (RESOLVED)
**Issue**: Private agent names exposed in 4 public-facing files
**Impact**: Production-blocking for public release
**Resolution**: Gate 6.1 remediation (10 minutes)
**Prevention**: Privacy audit now first step of pre-release verification

### Blocker 2: License Type Assumption (RESOLVED)
**Issue**: Assumed MIT license without checking AGET standards
**Impact**: Would have used wrong license for public release
**Resolution**: Framework standards audit identified correct license (Apache 2.0)
**Prevention**: "Check configuration first" protocol now reinforced

## Patterns Discovered

### Pattern 1: Configuration-First Protocol Violation
**Observation**: Three critical items missed by not checking configuration first:
1. Gate 6: Privacy audit (protocol existed, not executed)
2. Gate 7 planning: License type (standard exists, not checked)
3. Gate 7.1: Framework standards (patterns exist, assumed instead)

**Pattern**: When facing "standard" decisions, both worker and supervisor operate in "general knowledge mode" instead of "AGET-specific configuration mode."

**Impact**: Human caught all three issues, not worker or supervisor.

**Root cause**: Configuration-first protocol exists but not consistently applied.

**Solution**:
- Add "framework standards checklist" step to planning
- Apply same discipline as testing protocols
- Verify assumptions before committing to plan

### Pattern 2: Speed vs Thoroughness Trade-off
**Observation**: Gate 6 completed in 30 min (vs 45min-1.25h estimate) but missed critical privacy audit step.

**Pattern**: Optimizing for speed → skipping protocol steps → discovering issues later.

**Evidence**:
- Gate 3.2: 67% tested (skipped testing) → Gate 3.2.5 correction required
- Gate 6: Skipped privacy audit → Gate 6.1 correction required
- Gate 7: Assumed MIT → Framework audit required

**Solution**: Execute all protocol steps, don't skip for speed. Front-load quality → backend velocity.

### Pattern 3: Supervisor-Worker Alignment on Assumptions
**Observation**: Both supervisor and worker made same MIT assumption.

**Pattern**: When both parties operate from general knowledge, assumptions align and reinforce (even if incorrect).

**Risk**: Neither party catches framework-specific errors → human must catch.

**Mitigation**: Framework standards audit as standard pre-release step.

## Metrics

### Time Tracking
- Gate 6.1 (Privacy): 10 min (estimate: 10-15 min) ✅
- Framework Audit: 5 min (estimate: 5 min) ✅
- Gate 7.1 (Pre-release): 18 min (estimate: 15-20 min) ✅
- **Session total**: ~3 hours (discussion + execution)

### Quality Metrics
- Privacy violations found: 4 files
- Privacy violations fixed: 4 files (100%)
- Framework assumptions found: 1 (license type)
- Framework standards verified: 6
- Test pass rate: 30/30 (100%)

### Process Metrics
- Gates planned: 5 (Gates 7.1-7.5)
- Gates completed: 1 (Gate 7.1)
- Correction gates: 1 (Gate 6.1)
- Human interventions: 3 (privacy catch, license correction, planning feedback)

## Learning Applied

### From Previous Sessions
1. **Gate 3.2.5 lesson** (test-while-building): Applied throughout Gate 7.1 - verified each component immediately
2. **Incremental gates**: Gate 6.1 and 7.1 both used systematic verify → fix → re-verify pattern
3. **Evidence-based verification**: All Gate 7.1 checks backed by grep/test output

### New Learning This Session
1. **Configuration-first protocol**: Must check framework standards before assuming "industry standard"
2. **Pre-release audit timing**: Privacy and framework standards must be verified BEFORE repository creation (Gates 7.2+)
3. **Assumption alignment risk**: When supervisor and worker both operate from general knowledge, errors propagate

## Next Session Preparation
